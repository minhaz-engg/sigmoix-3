One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 60x13mmHole Size: 25mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetGrade: Y35Application: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.",

They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 60x13mmHole Size: 25mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetGrade: Y35Application: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating.

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x6mmHole Size: 22mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetColor: BlackFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.Package Include: 1x BLACK 40mm RING MAGNETS 40x6mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent Magnet",

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x8mmHole Size: 18mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetColor: BlackFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.Package Include: 1x BLACK 40mm RING MAGNETS 40x8mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet 40x8mm Permanent Magnet",

Color: Black Magnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom plane Description: Ring Magnets Black- 50x10mm BLACK 50mm RING MAGNETS 50x10mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent Magnet This ferrite ring magnet has an outside diameter of 50mm, an inside diameter of 25mm and a thickness of 10mm. Our ferrite ring magnets are often used in loudspeakers and also in resonance imaging and torque drives. One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture. A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized. Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors. Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components. Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces. Specifications: Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring Magnet Size: 50x10mm Hole Size: 25mm Shape: Ring Material: Ferrite Magnet Grade: Y35 Application: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc. Color: Black Magnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom plane Features: Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors. Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation. Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don't have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets. Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.",

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it’s suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more. Great as a cabinet or shower door catcher.Best Coating Available: Ni+ Cu+ Ni triple layer coated. The best coating available, which provides a shiny and rust resistant protection for the magnets.MAGNETS COATED: The magnets are made from the very strong neodymium-iron-boron alloy (NdFeB) and have a stylish nickel coating (Ni-Cu-Ni) with an appealing silver surface.Grade N52: The Strongest Grade Available and therefore Stronger Than Any Comparable Products of a Lower Grade such as N35, N42, N45, N48.MULTIPLE USES :These Magnets are Ideal for DIY Purposes, as Refrigerator Magnets, Science Project Magnets, at Work or in the Office, for Scientific Purposes, for Arts and Crafts or in the Classroom at School.Personality & beautiful: Good Choice for your DIY projects, useful item for offices, home, etc .the uses is endless.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x 15x4x2mm Rectangular Neodymium Magnet 15x4x2mm Industrial Super Strong Neodymium Magnets Super Strength Permanent Magnet For Garage Craft Art",

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x 15x4x2mm Rectangular Neodymium Magnet 15x4x2mm Industrial Super Strong Neodymium Magnets Super Strength Permanent Magnet For Garage Craft Art",

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x 15x4x2mm Rectangular Neodymium Magnet 15x4x2mm Industrial Super Strong Neodymium Magnets Super Strength Permanent Magnet For Garage Craft Art"

Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x Disc Neodymium Magnet 30x5mm With Countersunk Hole Industrial Super Strong Rare Earth Neodymium Bar Magnets Super Strength Permanent NdFeB N42 Magnet For Garage Science Projects"

They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields.

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance.

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 36x8mmShape: Ring Hole 18mmMaterial: Ferrite MagnetApplication: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeSize may be little bit Plus MinusFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x Disc Neodymium Magnet 10x1mm Industrial Super Strong Rare Earth Neodymium Disc Magnets Super Strength Permanent NdFeB N35 Magnet For Garage Kitchen Science Craft Projects",

So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table."

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table"

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it’s suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more. Great as a cabinet or shower door catcher.Best Coating Available: Ni+ Cu+ Ni triple layer coated. The best coating available, which provides a shiny and rust resistant protection for the magnets.MAGNETS COATED: The magnets are made from the very strong neodymium-iron-boron alloy (NdFeB) and have a stylish nickel coating (Ni-Cu-Ni) with an appealing silver surface.Grade N52: The Strongest Grade Available and therefore Stronger Than Any Comparable Products of a Lower Grade such as N35, N42, N45, N48.MULTIPLE USES :These Magnets are Ideal for DIY Purposes, as Refrigerator Magnets, Science Project Magnets, at Work or in the Office, for Scientific Purposes, for Arts and Crafts or in the Classroom at School.Personality & beautiful: Good Choice for your DIY projects, useful item for offices, home, etc .the uses is endless.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance.

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x8mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetApplication: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeSize may be little bit Plus MinusFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating.

They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x8mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetApplication: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeSize may be little bit Plus MinusFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating.

Color: Black Magnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom plane Size may be little bit Plus Minus Description: Ring Magnets BlackBLACK 40mm RING MAGNETS 40x8mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent MagnetOur ferrite ring magnets are often used in loudspeakers and also in resonance imaging and torque drives. One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet.

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it's suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more. Great as a cabinet or shower door catcher.Best Coating Available: Ni+ Cu+ Ni triple layer coated. The best coating available, which provides a shiny and rust resistant protection for the magnets.MAGNETS COATED: The magnets are made from the very strong neodymium-iron-boron alloy (NdFeB) and have a stylish nickel coating (Ni-Cu-Ni) with an appealing silver surface.Grade N52: The Strongest Grade Available and therefore Stronger Than Any Comparable Products of a Lower Grade such as N35, N42, N45, N48.MULTIPLE USES :These Magnets are Ideal for DIY Purposes, as Refrigerator Magnets, Science Project Magnets, at Work or in the Office, for Scientific Purposes, for Arts and Crafts or in the Classroom at School.Personality & beautiful: Good Choice for your DIY projects, useful item for offices, home, etc .the uses is endless.

It is a rare earth metal and forms one of the Lanthanides series. When added to Iron (Fe) and Boron (B) (chemical formula Nd14Fe21B) the resultant magnets are the strongest magnets currently available. Neodymium magnets are sometimes known as Neo, Neod or NIB magnets.The Neodymium magnets are usually coated Nickel-Copper-Nickel plating to prevent the iron from rusting. Neodymium magnets are made of a brittle material. These magnets are not as strong as steel. They are more like a brittle ceramic. If you let two magnets slam together, they can crack and break. This is true for magnets large and small. Warning: These magnets are very powerful which should be handled with great care. Children should not be allowed to handle neodymium magnets, as they can be dangerous. These magnets are not toys.

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 45x8mmHole Size: 19mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetColor: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.Package Include: 1x BLACK 45mm RING MAGNETS 45x8mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent Magnet",

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x Disc Neodymium Magnet 30x5mm With Countersunk Hole Industrial Super Strong Rare Earth Neodymium Bar Magnets Super Strength Permanent NdFeB N42 Magnet For Garage Science Projects"

Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x Disc Neodymium Magnet 15x2mm Industrial Super Strong Rare Earth Neodymium Disc Magnets Super Strength Permanent NdFeB N35 Magnet For Garage Kitchen Science Craft Projects"

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it’s suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more. Great as a cabinet or shower door catcher.Best Coating Available: Ni+ Cu+ Ni triple layer coated. The best coating available, which provides a shiny and rust resistant protection for the magnets.MAGNETS COATED: The magnets are made from the very strong neodymium-iron-boron alloy (NdFeB) and have a stylish nickel coating (Ni-Cu-Ni) with an appealing silver surface.Grade N52: The Strongest Grade Available and therefore Stronger Than Any Comparable Products of a Lower Grade such as N35, N42, N45, N48.MULTIPLE USES :These Magnets are Ideal for DIY Purposes, as Refrigerator Magnets, Science Project Magnets, at Work or in the Office, for Scientific Purposes, for Arts and Crafts or in the Classroom at School.Personality & beautiful: Good Choice for your DIY projects, useful item for offices, home, etc .the uses is endless.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x6mmHole Size: 22mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetColor: BlackFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.Package Include: 1x BLACK 40mm RING MAGNETS 40x6mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent Magnet",

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x8mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetApplication: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeSize may be little bit Plus MinusFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.সাইজ একটু কম বেশি হতে পারে",

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it’s suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.Package Include:1x 15x4x2mm Rectangular Neodymium Magnet 15x4x2mm Industrial Super Strong Neodymium Magnets Super Strength Permanent Magnet For Garage Craft Art",

Color: Black Magnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom plane Description: Ring Magnets Black- 60x13mmBLACK 60mm RING MAGNETS 60x13mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent MagnetThis ferrite ring magnet has an outside diameter of 50mm, an inside diameter of 25mm and a thickness of 10mm.Our ferrite ring magnets are often used in loudspeakers and also in resonance imaging and torque drives. One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 60x13mmHole Size: 25mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetGrade: Y35Application: Speaker, Sensors, Separators, Microwaves Etc.Color: BlackMagnetization Direction: N S pole on top and bottom planeFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating.

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it’s suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more. Great as a cabinet or shower door catcher.Best Coating Available: Ni+ Cu+ Ni triple layer coated. The best coating available, which provides a shiny and rust resistant protection for the magnets.MAGNETS COATED: The magnets are made from the very strong neodymium-iron-boron alloy (NdFeB) and have a stylish nickel coating (Ni-Cu-Ni) with an appealing silver surface.Grade N52: The Strongest Grade Available and therefore Stronger Than Any Comparable Products of a Lower Grade such as N35, N42, N45, N48.MULTIPLE USES :These Magnets are Ideal for DIY Purposes, as Refrigerator Magnets, Science Project Magnets, at Work or in the Office, for Scientific Purposes, for Arts and Crafts or in the Classroom at School.Personality & beautiful: Good Choice for your DIY projects, useful item for offices, home, etc .the uses is endless.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

They boast of offering the highest energy product (of any material/magnets today) and are available in a wide variety of sizes, grades and shapes (discs, arcs, blocks, spheres, trapezoid etc.).NdFeB magnets are used in making many tools/equipment such as communication tools, computer devices, motors, sensors, speakers and medical treatment instruments just to mention a few tools/equipment.Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy.Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.Powerful Permanent Magnets: Neodymium is a kind of rare earth metal, it’s suitable for making permanent & powerful magnets. This magnet has permanent magnetism, it will be the same powerful even decades after. Constructed of a super strong neodymium block magnet embedded in a steel channel. Magnet is recessed inside the steel channel for protection and added holding power.Application: Useful neodymium magnets for holding, mounting, home improvement, DIY projects, and many more. Great as a cabinet or shower door catcher.Best Coating Available: Ni+ Cu+ Ni triple layer coated. The best coating available, which provides a shiny and rust resistant protection for the magnets.MAGNETS COATED: The magnets are made from the very strong neodymium-iron-boron alloy (NdFeB) and have a stylish nickel coating (Ni-Cu-Ni) with an appealing silver surface.Grade N52: The Strongest Grade Available and therefore Stronger Than Any Comparable Products of a Lower Grade such as N35, N42, N45, N48.MULTIPLE USES :These Magnets are Ideal for DIY Purposes, as Refrigerator Magnets, Science Project Magnets, at Work or in the Office, for Scientific Purposes, for Arts and Crafts or in the Classroom at School.Personality & beautiful: Good Choice for your DIY projects, useful item for offices, home, etc .the uses is endless.

Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved.Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV’s.It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets.Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together.When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed.Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects.To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table.",

One popular application for children is the fishing game, tied on a piece of string to pick up pins and needles. The ferrite rings offer reduced magnetic strength, due to the hole, but the inexpensive pricing makes them a firm favourite. Some applications are: holding, door closures, joinery, light fixture.A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements, such as barium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. They are both electrically non-conductive, meaning that they are insulators, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrite can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized.Hard ferrite have high coercive force, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors.Soft ferrite have low coercive, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components.Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult to demagnetize, and can be made with both high and low coercive forces.Specifications:Name: Ring Shaped Ferrite Ring MagnetSize: 40x6mmHole Size: 22mmShape: RingMaterial: Ferrite MagnetColor: BlackFeatures:Ferrite ring magnets withstand temperatures of up to 250°C and down to -40°C and can therefore be used both indoors and outdoors.Magnets should always be kept away from small children due to the risk of suffocation.Ferrite magnets are a bit fragile as they don’t have a protective coating. Avoid bumps and knocks. Only work with magnets using tools specially designed for magnets.Never keep magnets in close proximity to electrical equipment like mobile phones, computers, loudspeakers, hearing aids, pacemakers, etc.Package Include: 1x BLACK 40mm RING MAGNETS 40x6mm Ring Magnets Multipurpose Permanent Round Ring Magnet Permanent Magnet",
